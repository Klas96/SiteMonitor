5. Structure the cover letter as follows:
   a. Begin the response with document class article
   a. Opening paragraph: Introduce the applicant and state the position they're applying for

   c. Closing paragraph: Express enthusiasm for the position and organization, say that you would be happy to discuss more
   d. Closing salutation and end the latex document

   - Use a standard business letter format
   - Use clear, concise language and short paragraphs
   - The result will be compiled with latex
   - use only \n \bigskip, \noinden, \documentclass{article}, \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}, \title, \author \date(<DateInsertLater>), \begin{document}, \maketitle use on opening and ending statement
   - Don't exaggerate too much


8. Reductions:
   - Research Engineer in affinity proteomics and analysis of protein biomarkers at the School of Engineering Sciences in Chemistry, Biotechnology and Health at KTH. Becomes Research Engineer at KTH
   - Do similar for other cases

9. Write your latex cover letter inside <latex_cover_letter> tags. Do not include any explanations or notes outside of these tags.



Remember to customize the letter to the specific job and organization, and to highlight the applicant's most relevant qualifications and experiences. The goal is to create a compelling case for why the applicant is a great fit for the position. As well as presenting the applicant in a human way.
